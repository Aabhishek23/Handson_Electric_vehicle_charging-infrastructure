# Buck Converter Simulation in MATLAB Simulink
Overview
This project demonstrates the simulation of a buck converter using MATLAB Simulink. A buck converter is a type of DC/DC power converter that steps down voltage from its input (source) to its output (load). In this project, we model and analyze the behavior of a buck converter to understand its operation and design considerations.

# Key Features
Buck Converter Operation: Explore how the buck converter efficiently steps down voltage while maintaining power transfer.
Continuous Conduction Mode: Understand the theoretical transfer function of the buck converter in continuous conduction mode.
Simulation Setup: Set up the buck converter model, including the input voltage, duty cycle, and load.
Waveform Analysis: Observe waveforms, such as input voltage, output voltage, and inductor current, using Simulink scopes.
Verification: Verify that the mean value of the load voltage matches the theoretical value based on the duty cycle.

# How to Use
Install MATLAB and Simulink: Ensure you have MATLAB and Simulink installed on your system.
Open the Simulink Model: Open the provided Simulink model (buck_converter.slx).
Run the Simulation: Execute the simulation and observe the waveforms.
Analyze Results: Check if the output voltage aligns with the theoretical value.
